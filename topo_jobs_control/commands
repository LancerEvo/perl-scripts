# Use sharp symbol "#" for comments. AS in this line.
# White lines are ignored. So you can use white line/lines as a seperator to imporve readablity.
# You should make sure the command is syntax-correct. This means:
#	a. For muli-line command, each line is ended with a space and a backslash(" \")
#	b. The last line of a multi-line command DOES NOT need the backslash.
#	E.g.:
#		command-line-1 \
#		command-line-2 \
#		command-line-last
#
